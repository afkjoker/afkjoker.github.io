<p>I literally just finished setting up this blog, thanks to @iframe and his creation, Starship.
With the use of several internet searches, the blurring effects and certain styling CSS add-ons
were added, and we can all agree it looks MUCH nicer than my old version, which, even though I
was using it just yesterday, seems <b>extremely</b> outdated. The link for it is below, but I
doubt you'll find anything that sparks your interest. The snow theme was completely random, but
it turns out to look pretty nice, and that's relieving.</p>
<p><a href="https://afkjoker.github.io/Log_of_an_AFK_Joker/" target="_blank">old blog</a></p>
<p>At first when I set the background into the blog, it was split into various squares like an
unfinished puzzle, the angles very wrong. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning about Starship
and its formatting, but it's absolutely <b>amazing</b> and is <b>so</b> easy to deal with,
especially for writing long posts, like this one. Also, I'd never thought I could insert the
"read more" factor, but apparently I can, now that Starship is a thing.</p>
<p>The making itself of this blog originated from @iframe teaching me programming and terminal
uses, and eventually the challenge came to "making a website." At first, it sounded really 
complicated and I was sort of intimidated, but once we got the IP file converted to a real website,
everything was a lot simpler, and github is super convenient to deal with. Also, the HTML commands
are not that complex, so I was able to pick them up decently fast. Turns out, Starship is even
easier than normal github. @iframe even made shortcuts for making posts, so you don't have to
do every single command manually in a text editor and terminal. Really nice!</p>
<p>Pittsburgh weather has been very nice lately. It's very warm, unlike the heatwave and unlike
the freezing-to-death-winter times, which enables swimming as a nice activity for free time.
There was one day when there was a severe thunderstorm and several tornado warnings, but knowing
Pittsburgh's weather, nothing much happened, and it was just typical loud thunder. Miraculously
no power outages, which I am weird enough to like. It means free reading with the lights off for
another few hours. And hey, one should always know what it was like in the <b>olden times</b>, right?</p>
<p>And that's the end of my midnight post. Toodeloo!</p>
