<p>I have to admit, summer can be nice... until the heatwave begins and you're
trapped in nothing but hundred degrees Fahrenheit and above. In Pittsburgh, we
often have mosquito and insect outbreaks. As far as I know, my record for bites is
seventy-two in one month. Granted, I'd spent a little under half my time that month
outside, so it wasn't entirely nature's fault. People say calamine lotion helps
with itching. I want to say it does, and it sometimes helps with swelling, but the
itches <b>never</b> stop until you quit going out. And after the whole month, it
still took about a week for the swelling to finally decrease. The sun is also a big
con of summer, as I don't exactly approve of sunglasses, and am too lazy to apply
sunscreen on a regular daily basis. Wish me luck on escaping heatstroke!!!</p>
