<p>Happy Fourth of July, even though I wrote two posts during the Fourth of July already! Lately
I've been thinking about how insane it would sound if I turned words into mixes of words, and then
spoke with them all day long. For example, maybe "paper" would be "flat writing material". Then, to
address paper, I would say, "I'm going to go get some flat writing material." Fun, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now I've been thinking about what to call the Fourth of July. After all, it <b>is</b> sort of
about fireworks, so it could be called "the time period of sky comets". But then that could also
relate to the New Year, because it is the same, so that's out of the question.</p>
<p>"The summer time period of sky comets".</p>
<p>But that's too bland, and also "summer" should be elaborated on. "The hot season time period of
sky comets." But "season" still needs to be explained. "The hot year fraction time period of sky
comets." That sounds better, but still not ideal. "The hot year section time period of sky comets."
Hmmm. Maybe I'll let that pass.</p>

<p>P.S. Just checking in, I didn't doze off in the middle of my last post, right?</p>
