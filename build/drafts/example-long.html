<p>Hello! This is an example of a longer post.</p>

<p>You can have as much body content as you want,
and in whatever format, as long as[[ENDSUM]] it is
valid HTML. If you want to add extra styling, like
for example a span class with animated rainbow
lettering, go for it!</p>

<p>Posts can have more than one [[ENDSUM]], but only
the first one is parsed as a summary boundary. :)</p>

<p><pre class="code">
Here is an example of custom formatting.<br>

Just add whatever CSS you need into <b>style.css</b> and it'll work!
</pre></p>
